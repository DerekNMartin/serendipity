# Serendipity ðŸŽ²

I always have a hard time choosing what to read next!

Serendipity is a little, animated randomizer built with React, TypeScript, and Framer Motion - it cycles through your options with dynamic motion effects before landing on your fate.

Currently interfacing with OpenLibrary's API for search results.
Eventually would like to expand to movies, food etc.

Design is inspired by Neo-Brutalism.
